## üöÄ **Getting Started Locally**

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### **Prerequisites**

-   **Docker Desktop**: Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and Docker Compose installed on your system.
-   **Git**: You'll need Git to clone the repository.

### **Installation & Setup**

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/thuan-NM/Portfolio.git
    cd Portfolio


2.  **Configure EmailJS Credentials:**
    Before you can use the contact form, you need to add your personal EmailJS keys.
    -   Navigate to `js/contact-form.js`.
    -   Update the `emailJsConfig` object with your credentials:

        const emailJsConfig = {
          serviceId: 'YOUR_SERVICE_ID',
          templateId: 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID',
          publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY',
        };


3.  **Run with Docker Compose:**
    This single command will build the Docker image and start the Nginx server.

    docker-compose up -d --build


4.  **View in Browser:**
    Once the container is running, open your favorite browser and go to:
    **[http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)**

## üö¢ **Deployment & Automation**

This project is configured for automated deployment using GitHub Actions.

-   **Workflow**: The `.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml` file defines the CI/CD pipeline.
-   **Trigger**: The workflow runs automatically on every `push` to the `main` branch.
-   **Action**: It builds the `Dockerfile`, logs into Docker Hub, and pushes the new image tagged as `latest`.

To enable this for your own fork, you must configure the following secrets in your repository settings:
-   `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
-   `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: An access token generated from your Docker Hub account.
